✅ It shows Information About Major League's Standings, Stats, Top Scorers, Trending News.

✅ It Uses Material UI for React Components, Redux, its Proxy Server is Made Using Node.js, which takes information from Sports-API ( Had To Do This Due To Low Requests Given By API Provider on Free Plan ).

✅ Proxy Server is Hosted On Cyclic.sh and React App is Hosted On Netlify.

🚫 Incase Some Information is Not Visible and is in Loading State for Long Period of Time, Consider Refreshing a Couple of Times. (This Happens due to Low Quality Servers Provided in Free Plan of Server Hosting)


### Thanks....❤️
